title: Experienced Band with hundreds of gigs
description: The number one comment is about their diverse range of music. One
  club owner said, “I’ve been in the business a long time and can usually tell
  what a band’s next song will be, but with you guys, you never know.” From
  dance to just listening, the band has the music to satisfy. They are an
  experienced band with 100’s of performances and years of experience in all
  types of venues. Quality equipment and great sound are very important to the
  band. They enjoy playing Classic Vinyl, Blues, Rock, Country and Gospel. They
  play gigs of all types including clubs, civic functions, weddings, private and
  holiday parties. They also play smaller venue and acoustic gigs.
